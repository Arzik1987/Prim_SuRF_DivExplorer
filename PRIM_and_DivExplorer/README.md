## PRIM and DivExplorer

This folder contains the code to apply PRIM to the discretized COMPAS data used for the case study in [Looking for Trouble:
Analyzing Classifier Behavior via Pattern Divergence](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3448016.3457284) using the DivExplorer SD method.
The notebook allows to produce the result for PRIM and PRIM* that we report in the table. Note that currently the output of PRIM lists the values of the attributes that are part of the subgroup description, while the output of PRIM* lists the values that are NOT part of the subgroup description. We are working on unifying the results display to make the use of both versions of PRIM consistent.
